## About
"Ava to the rescue" is a project developed by Catarina Maia, Mariana Nunes and Jorge Guedes and Tiago Lourenco, as the final project for the studIO, a 25-week asynchronous peer-to-peer full-stack online study program from Academia de Codigo. The task at hand: a Single Page Application centered around the character Ava from the movie Ex - Machina. We decided to fetch three different APIs, so that Ava could turn into one's sidekick, providing a cocktail recipe, a random joke or a cool song to get the party going.

## Languages and technologies used for building this app
We implemented our web app's logic using JavaScript, relying on hash-based routing, the History API, and integrated a REST API. For the visual identity of our app, we utilized HTML and CSS.

## Links to the APIs consumed by the app
