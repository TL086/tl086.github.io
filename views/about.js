    <p>"Ava to the rescue" is a project developed by Catarina Maia, Mariana Nunes, Jorge Guedes and Tiago Lourenco as a final project for the studIO,
     a 25-week asynchronous peer-to-peer full-stack online study program from Academia de Codigo.
    <p> The task at hand: a Single Page Application centered around the character Ava from the movie Ex - Machina.</p>
    <p>Ava is like your trusty sidekick for those awkward social moments. Imagine feeling all cringy and unsure at a party â€“ that's where Ava swoops in.</p>
    <p>She's got your back and offers you three cool options:</p>
    <ul><li>first up, a joke to lighten the mood;</li><li> then there's crafting a funky cocktail;</li>
    <li>and last, but not least, diving into a cool song that will make anyone want to dance.</li></ul>
    <p>With these tricks up your sleeve, suddenly those nerve-wracking situations don't seem so daunting. "Ava to the rescue" turns you into the life of the party.</p>
    <p>It's like having your own personal cheerleader, but in app form (so no one can see you're cheating).
